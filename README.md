#PlantUML Tests

I was able to install graphviz, the extension, setup a project, and create a hello world diagram in less than 30 minutes. Change the source code for the diagram and run the plantUML export command (I did with the vscode extension) and then it will generate a file than you can source control. I could see git hooks being very useful here.
